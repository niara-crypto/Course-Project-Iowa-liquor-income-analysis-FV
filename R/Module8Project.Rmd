4.  **Conclusion**

[Analytical methodology]{.underline}: An initial analysis shows a weak negative trend between median income and per-capita liquor sales.

[Limitations]{.underline} of the methodology include a relatively short time period of 4 years as opposed to an extensive study over several decades. Also, as the data is only coming from Iowa, we cannot be certain that the results could also be applied to other geographic areas of the U.S. or even Iowa's neighboring states.

[Future work]{.underline} would include performing a similar analysis across the states in the U.S. to determine whether the trend that was found in Iowa is an outlier or if Iowa is a fair representation of the U.S. as a whole, and to conduct data collection over a longer period of time. It would be interesting to see as well if the sales data could be broken down by quarter and age group to see if there are parts of the year where people are purchasing more alcohol than others.

5.  **Policy Recommendation**

A [potential policy decision]{.underline} for an Iowa policy maker would be to limit the sales of alcohol to people under the age of 25. Given that counties with lower incomes (and in theory younger workers) tend to consume more alcohol and the known negative health consequences that it can have, encouraging people to drink less alcohol would improve public health. Since younger workers tend to make less money than those in their 40s and 50s, the data may indicate that they may be more likely to spend more of their money on alcohol.

[Recommendation]{.underline}: Our recommendation is implement a pilot program that limits the sale of alcohol in big-box stores (Costco, Sam's Club, BJ's) to customers between the ages of 21-25.

[Effects]{.underline}: A first order effect would be a potential decrease in sales for these stores. However, this is something the government could alleviate through a tax incentive for the companies. A second order effect is lost jobs for the state's liquor companies if their products are popular among this cohort.

[Benefits and Risks]{.underline}: Benefits to residents in Iowa 21-25 include improved health and a reduction in alcohol dependence. Financially this would also allow them to save more of their money and use it for other expenses. As a result the state's health system would be less burdened by alcohol-related visits, including potentially emergency room visits and drunk-driving related incidents. Risks include encouraging residents to seek alternative ways of obtaining alcohol through legal and illegal means, in which case the policy would not be effective.
